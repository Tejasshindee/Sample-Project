We preprocess data with Python and Spark, employ ML techniques for segmentation, visualize insights with Tableau, and store data in MySQL. Through this integration, we aim to understand customer behavior, segment customers based on patterns and demographics, and optimize marketing strategies for enhanced customer satisfaction and business growth.













Our project, "Customer Segmentation Through Purchase History Data," utilizes Python, Spark, ML (RFM method, K-means clustering), Tableau, and MySQL. Data preprocessing occurs using Python and Spark, with ML techniques enabling segmentation based on purchasing behavior and demographics. The insights derived from segmentation are visualized using Tableau. Additionally, the processed data is stored in MySQL for efficient management.

By integrating these tools, our project aims to provide businesses with insights into their customer base. This understanding enables targeted marketing campaigns, personalized recommendations, and optimized strategies. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance customer satisfaction, drive growth, and maintain competitiveness. Through effective segmentation and visualization of purchase history data, businesses can make data-driven decisions leading to tangible improvements in engagement and performance.
